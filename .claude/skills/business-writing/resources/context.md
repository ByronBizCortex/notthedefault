# Business Writing Context - Principles & Frameworks

## My Writing Philosophy

### Core Principles for Good Writing

#### Clarity Above All
- **Simple words over complex ones**
  - Use "use" not "utilize"
  - Use "help" not "facilitate"
  - Use "end" not "terminate"
- **Short sentences beat long ones**
  - Aim for 15-20 words per sentence
  - One idea per sentence
  - Break up run-ons
- **Active voice over passive**
  - "We launched the product" not "The product was launched"
  - "The team solved the problem" not "The problem was solved by the team"
- **Concrete over abstract**
  - Use specific examples
  - Provide numbers and data
  - Paint clear pictures

#### Reader-First Thinking
- **Know your audience**
  - What do they care about?
  - What's their level of knowledge?
  - What action do you want them to take?
- **Lead with what matters to them**
  - Benefits before features
  - Value before process
  - Answer "So what?" immediately
- **Respect their time**
  - Get to the point quickly
  - Use formatting for scannability
  - Provide a TL;DR for long pieces

#### Structure & Flow
- **Tell them what you're going to tell them**
  - Strong opening that sets expectations
  - Clear preview of what's coming
- **Tell them**
  - Deliver on the promise
  - Logical progression
  - Smooth transitions
- **Tell them what you told them**
  - Recap key points
  - Clear next steps
  - Strong close

#### Editing is Writing
- **First draft is just thinking on paper**
  - Get ideas out without editing
  - Expect it to be rough
- **Real writing happens in revision**
  - Cut ruthlessly
  - Tighten everything
  - Read aloud to catch awkwardness
- **Kill your darlings**
  - Remove clever phrases that don't serve the purpose
  - Delete interesting tangents
  - Cut to the essence

### My Writing Process

1. **Understand the goal** - What should the reader think/feel/do after reading?
2. **Know the audience** - Who are they and what do they care about?
3. **Brain dump** - Get all ideas out without judgment
4. **Outline** - Organize into logical flow
5. **Draft** - Write without editing
6. **Rest** - Walk away for a bit
7. **Edit ruthlessly** - Cut, tighten, clarify
8. **Read aloud** - Catch what the eye misses
9. **Get feedback** - Fresh eyes find issues
10. **Final polish** - Fix typos, formatting, flow

## April Dunford's Pitch Framework

### Why I Use This Framework
- **Positioning-driven**: Builds on solid positioning work
- **Story-based**: Engages audience emotionally
- **Customer-focused**: Centers on customer value, not product features
- **Proven**: Works across industries and formats

### The Sales Story Structure

#### 1. Set the Scene (Context)
**Purpose:** Help them understand the world where your product exists

**Elements:**
- What's changed in the market/world?
- Why now? Why does this matter?
- Set up the problem without mentioning your product yet

**Example Opening:**
"The way companies buy software has fundamentally changed. Buyers now research online, compare alternatives, and make decisions before ever talking to sales. Yet most B2B websites still assume buyers will call to learn about products..."

#### 2. Introduce the Enemy (The Problem)
**Purpose:** Make the problem visceral and urgent

**Elements:**
- What's the real problem (not just "lack of our solution")?
- Why is the status quo painful?
- What alternatives exist and why do they fail?
- Make it personal and specific

**The "Enemy" Formula:**
- Name it clearly
- Show the pain it causes
- Explain why existing solutions don't work
- Create urgency

**Example:**
"Companies lose millions in revenue because prospects leave their website without understanding the value. Traditional 'Contact Us' forms create friction. Generic content doesn't resonate. And prospects disappear into the void..."

#### 3. Show the Promised Land (The Solution World)
**Purpose:** Paint a picture of success WITHOUT your product yet

**Elements:**
- What does life look like when the problem is solved?
- What becomes possible?
- How do things work differently?
- Make them want to live in this world

**Key:** Describe the outcome, not your product
- Not: "Our AI-powered widget..."
- But: "Imagine if prospects could instantly see exactly how your product solves their specific problem, in their own words..."

#### 4. Introduce Your Product as the Path
**Purpose:** Position your product as the unique way to reach the Promised Land

**Elements:**
- Your unique approach/capabilities
- Why you're different from alternatives
- Proof that you can deliver
- How you make the transformation possible

**Connection Formula:**
"To get to [Promised Land], you need [Unique Capability]. That's exactly what [Your Product] does."

#### 5. Provide the Evidence
**Purpose:** Build credibility and prove it works

**Elements:**
- Customer stories and results
- Data and metrics
- Awards, recognition, credibility markers
- Demo or proof of concept

**Types of Evidence:**
- **Numbers**: "500% increase in qualified leads"
- **Stories**: Customer transformation narratives
- **Social proof**: "Used by 7 of the top 10 [industry] companies"
- **Demonstration**: Show, don't just tell

#### 6. Show How It Works (The Mechanics)
**Purpose:** Make it tangible and believable

**Elements:**
- Simple explanation of how it works
- Key features that enable the magic
- Integration with their workflow
- Ease of getting started

**Keep It Simple:**
- 3-5 key points maximum
- Focus on "how" not "what"
- Connect features to value
- Avoid technical jargon

### Adapting the Framework

**For a Pitch Deck:**
- 1 slide per section
- Visual > text
- Rehearse transitions

**For Website Copy:**
- Homepage hero = Promised Land
- "Problem" section = Enemy
- "How it Works" = Path
- Case studies = Evidence

**For Email:**
- Subject line = Hook into problem
- Opening = Set scene briefly
- Body = Promised Land + Path
- Close = Evidence + CTA

**For Blog/Article:**
- Opening paragraph = Set scene
- Early sections = Enemy
- Middle = Promised Land
- Later sections = Your approach
- Examples throughout = Evidence

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Starting with your product** - Lead with the problem/opportunity
2. **Features before benefits** - Always value first
3. **Vague promised land** - Be specific and visceral
4. **Weak enemy** - If the problem isn't painful, they won't buy
5. **Too much "how it works"** - Keep it high-level
6. **No proof** - Claims without evidence fall flat
