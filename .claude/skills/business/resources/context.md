## My Preferred Frameworks & Methodologies

### Jobs to be Done (JTBD)
**Why I use this:**
- Focuses on customer needs, not product features
- Helps identify true customer problems
- Reveals opportunities competitors miss

**How I apply it:**
- Interview customers about their "job to be done"
- Identify functional, emotional, and social dimensions
- Design solutions that get the job done better
- Map customer journey and switching costs

**Key Questions:**
- What job is the customer hiring this product to do?
- What are they firing (current solution)?
- What progress are they trying to make?

### April Dunford's Positioning Framework
**Why I use this:**
- Clear, actionable positioning process
- Differentiates in crowded markets
- Aligns entire go-to-market strategy

**The Framework:**
1. **Understand the customers who love you** - Who gets the most value?
2. **Form a positioning team** - Cross-functional input
3. **Align on your competitive alternatives** - What would they use if you didn't exist?
4. **Isolate your unique attributes** - What can you do that alternatives can't?
5. **Map attributes to value** - What value does each attribute provide?
6. **Encapsulate the value you deliver** - Your value proposition
7. **Identify your best-fit customers** - Who cares most about this value?
8. **Capture your positioning** - Document for alignment
9. **Layer on a trend** - Make it timely and relevant
10. **Develop your sales story** - Narrative that sells

**Application:**
- Use this before product launch
- Revisit when entering new markets
- Update when competitive landscape changes

### Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)
**Why I use PRDs:**
- Forces clarity on what we're building and why
- Aligns team before development starts
- Creates accountability and decision record

**My PRD Template:**
- Problem statement
- Target users and use cases
- Goals and success metrics
- Requirements (must-have vs. nice-to-have)
- User stories
- Open questions
- Out of scope (important!)

### Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method (SSADM)
**Why I use this:**
- Systematic approach to system design
- Clear documentation and communication
- Reduces rework and misunderstandings

**Key Stages I Apply:**
1. Feasibility study
2. Requirements analysis
3. Logical system specification
4. Physical design

**Tools I Use:**
- Data flow diagrams
- Entity relationship diagrams
- Logical data modeling
- Process modeling

### The Business Cortex Framework
**What it is:**
- [Add description of the Business Cortex framework]
- [Core principles and components]
- [How it connects to your work]

**How I apply it:**
- [Your specific application]
- [When you use it]
